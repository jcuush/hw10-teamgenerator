# Unit 10 OOP Homework: Template Engine - Description

This project is designed for the user to answer prompts to give information about team members and then create an html page with the information of each team member.  This project allows for only a single manager to be added to each team and any number of engineers/interns to be added.  The html page allows for quick access of each team member's name, id, and email.  Additionally for the manager, engineer and intern role it gives information about the office number, github profile and school respectively.

## Usage

Run project by installing npm packages in terminal.


## Functions

This project incorporated many of the functions that we had learned in bootcamp.  This included creating a parent class file that was then exported and extended to subclasses that allowed for additional properties to be added depending on the team members role.  Using the inquirer npm package allowed for prompts to be asked in the console log to put the user input into html.  Tests were ran to ensure that all functions were working property and become more familiar with the jest package.  Additionally 'fs' allowed for the html file to be written from the javascript.

## Problems

Had a little problem figuring out using the outpath for the app.js to create the team.html (google helped).  Additionally I feel that I could have made my code cleaner in tying the functions together but am still figuring out the correct etiquette for structure of functions and when to create new files vs working out of a large js file.
